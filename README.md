UI for a Chess Game. To be used with backend https://github.com/dbrewster42/chess-oop
terminal ```npm start```

can only be used locally at this time. 

This is really only a companion piece to display the capabilities of the backend. I am not as interested in UI work so there are a lot of available improvements here.


TO DO

1. add [][] Squares
    then change state of individual squares instead of re-rendering whole board?

2. add password to login
